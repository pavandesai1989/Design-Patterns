The Abstract Factory design pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Key Points:
•	Provides an interface to create multiple related objects.
•	Encapsulates object creation logic without specifying concrete classes.
•	Helps maintain loose coupling and promotes scalability.
•	Often implemented using multiple factory methods.
