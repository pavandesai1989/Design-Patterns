| Pattern                     | Purpose                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chain of Responsibility** | Passes a request along a chain of handlers.                                 |
| **Command**                 | Encapsulates a request as an object.                                        |
| **Interpreter**             | Implements a grammar interpreter for a language.                            |
| **Iterator**                | Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially.             |
| **Mediator**                | Centralizes communication between components.                               |
| **Memento**                 | Captures and restores an object's internal state.                           |
| **Observer**                | Allows objects to be notified of state changes.                             |
| **State**                   | Allows an object to alter behavior when its internal state changes.         |
| **Strategy**                | Enables selecting an algorithm at runtime.                                  |
| **Template Method**         | Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, letting subclasses fill in the steps. |
| **Visitor**                 | Separates an algorithm from an object structure it operates on.             |
